# Coffee 2.0
Coffee 2.0 is a newer and more experienced version of Coffee, a previous bot I made.
It is a private bot, which means it functions only in a specific server and cannot be invited to a server by anyone but me, however it being private, to guide new users to the JDA and JDA-Utils this bot is open-source, you can read, learn and get inspired by this bot for your future and current projects.


# Libraries
Coffee 2.0 uses JDA, the main library for developing a Discord bot in Java, and JDA-Utils, another Discord Java library compatible with JDA that makes developing in JDA easier by adding tools and shortcuts.
