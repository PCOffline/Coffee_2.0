# Coffee 2.0
Coffee 2.0 is a rework on Coffee bot, which was once used to assist Java Clan. Its only use is at Java Clan's H&G server and includes Moderation, Fun, Utillities and other features.
This bot is a non-profit personal project to help me understand Java and JDA better as well as assist my server - Java Clan H&G.
You are welcomed to view all code to get inspired of this work and even help out by contacting PCOffline.

# Libraries
Currently, Coffee 2.0 (which shall be called Coffee) is using JDA, a Java library to connect and work with Discord API and JDA-Utils, another Java library to ease JDA processes with additions such as Command class and simpler access to some API features.

# Plans For Future
This bot will stay private forever, however, another bot - Coffee, without 2.0 - is planned to come out in the far future and be used as a public bot with neat features, inheriting the experience and code of this bot.
